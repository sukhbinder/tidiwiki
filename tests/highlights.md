Typically, after thanking those who helped in the creation of a book, the author adds a final note of thanks to his wife. For me, it is the place to start. Absent the love and support of Carol Wheeler, my life would be resoundingly less rich, and I most certainly would be a different person. Her wisdom is a North Star. Her love has shaped my existence. Within that broad scope, this book is a trifle, yet producing it required a shared commitment. Patience, understanding, and good humor are required as your husband retreats into research or pecks away at his computer, tasks go undone, and you are ignored. Tolerance is tested when an obscure discovery captures his imagination and dinner table conversations continually revert to that fascination. But beyond all that, Carol is the editor in chief: it doesn’t get in the book until it makes sense to her. Thank you to a great lady who plays so many roles so well!

While new networks may be the primary enabling force, history shows it is the secondary effects of such networks that are transformational. The last section of the book, therefore, looks at what is happening today and what is developing for tomorrow. The penultimate chapter reports on a select group of ongoing effects of today’s technology. While it is a subjective selection of topics based on personal experiences, it is nonetheless representative of our ongoing challenges.

Secondary effects matter more


--------------------

We have been here before. What we are presently experiencing is history’s third great network revolution.

The original information network was Johannes Gutenberg’s fifteenth-century discovery of movable-type printing. The network of printers that sprang up across Europe ended the monopoly of information that priests and princes had exploited in pursuit of power. The free movement of ideas fired the Reformation, spread the Renaissance, and became the basis of all that followed.

Four centuries passed before the next great network-driven transformation appeared. This time it was a pair of symbiotic networks: the railroad and the telegraph. Steam locomotives vanquished the geographic distances that had always defined the human experience. As if that weren’t revolution enough, the telegraph simultaneously eliminated time as a factor in the delivery of information. As one historian graphically described it, the resulting upheaval imposed the paradox of people living their lives “with one foot in manure and the other in the telegraph office.”7

Viewed in context, the changes of the twenty-first century do not yet measure up to the effects of printing, steam power, and messages by sparks. Today’s “revolutionary” technologies are a continuation of those earlier discoveries.

When Rupert Murdoch warned about the internet’s threat to publishing,9 for instance, he sounded very much like the sixteenth-century Vicar of Croydon warning “We must root out printing or printing will root out us.”10 Similarly, when today we complain about how constant connectivity is dominating our lives, we echo Henry David Thoreau’s lament that “we do not ride on the railroad, it rides on us,”11 or the warnings of nineteenth-century doctors who argued that by upsetting nature’s natural rhythm, the “whirl of the railways and the pelting of telegrams” would produce mental illness.12

Industrial companies that once employed thousands yield to internet companies with only a handful of employees. In 2012 the venerable photography company Kodak, which had once employed 165,000 people, went bankrupt. That same year, the internet photo-sharing service Instagram, with fifteen employees, sold for $1.2 billion.

The visionary behind this idea was a Polish immigrant named Paul Baran. In his 1964 paper, Baran proposed digitizing a voice phone call and then breaking that digital information into small packets of data. Instead of being sent over an end-to-end telephone circuit, the packets would be dispatched into a network of interconnected computers that would read the packet’s address and then pass it on to the next computer in the direction of its destination. If one computer was knocked out, the packets would work their way around the problem by being re-sent to other nodes.1

It was an idea as big as the bomb itself.

Communicating computers handing packets of data to each other across a distributed network would become the hardware and software model driving our current network revolution. Contrary to urban legend, it was not the internet. However, digitizing information into packets in order to move the functions of the network out of central points and closer to the network’s edge is the technological concept that underpins the internet.

Paul Baran’s visualization of a new network architecture reconfigured network concepts that had existed for millennia. It started us on the path to the third great network revolution.

Whereas the railroad compressed distance, the telegraph condensed time. From the beginning of history, the fact that information moved physically meant that it moved slowly, limited to the same speed as human travel.5 The telegraph separated the transfer of information from the transportation of hard copy. This virtualization of information further expanded the marketplace economy, brought forth unparalleled personal interaction, and laid the technological groundwork for the network that now defines the human experience.

As history’s first electronic network, the telegraph was the internet of its time.6 The only thing faster than a speeding locomotive, the telegraph controlled movement on the rails. But its impact was much more pervasive than managing train schedules. Information speeding faster than the wind made possible the creation of the Weather Bureau. News reports delivered from afar at lightning speed redefined both the nature of news and the news business. Electronic messages coordinated industrial production, created a new managerial class, and enabled the rise of powerful market-controlling corporations

While networks moved outward structurally, the economic activity they enabled moved in the opposite direction. Businesses seized on the network to build new centralized economic power. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil, Carnegie Steel, Montgomery Ward and Sears, Roebuck mail order, Swift and Armour meatpacking, and others built centralized empires using the railroad and telegraph. Today we see the same pattern. As the distributed digital network pushes its functions outward, new businesses such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon ride that network to create new centralized powerhouses.

The Catholic Church, threatened by the unlocking of information it had always controlled to produce individual conclusions it could not control, attempted to suppress the output of printers.

The canal companies, stagecoach and haulage firms, tavern owners, and others who were bypassed by the speeding railroad used everything from political muscle to vigilantism to derail the iron horse.

Messages delivered by “lightning” became fodder for pastors to frighten the faithful about how it could only be black magic, while the U.S. Post Office resisted its opportunity to adopt a technology faster than the mail.

Ultimately, however, such responses proved to be the rearguard of a retreat in the face of those who saw opportunity in the new networks.

The networks of history commanded the user to come to them: Come to the book. Come to the railhead. Come to the telegraph or telephone. The wirelessly distributed force of the new network does just the opposite. Now users command the network to come to them wherever they may be. It may seem a simple inversion, but its effect is this era’s nonlinear, nonobvious result. It is nothing less than the transfer of the nexus of power from the network to the user.

The little-known and poorly understood secret of all the previous network revolutions was that the network was in control to create hierarchies and define activity. For the first time in history, the new network puts its user in control.

--------------------

Those breakthroughs began with Gutenberg—and Gutenberg’s innovation was not simply a method for transferring ink to paper. His enduring insight was that for information to be automated and made “mass,” it had to be disassembled into small units and then reassembled. It was a groundbreaking discovery about the interface between information and machines. The concept lives on at the heart of the internet’s digital network, which breaks information into small packets for subsequent transmission and reassembly.

--------------------

We can see a direct relationship between the speed of a new network and the rate of innovative growth that speed stimulates. The acceleration of network speeds maps to the pace of technological change and the acceleration of economic and social change.

When information moved on horseback, it traveled at about four miles per hour.12 Measured in terms of data throughput, this was about 0.03 bits per second.13 The first network revolution, the movable-type printing press, increased the volume of data moved, but not its speed.

The railroad introduced speed into the equation. Moving five to ten times faster than animal power in its early iterations and later up to forty times faster, the iron horse accelerated the pace of life. The exponential growth of the railroad itself was a multiplier of the effect of its speed. In 1830 there were thirty miles of railroad track in the United States; by 1860 there were 30,000 miles of steel rails.14 Before the end of that decade, 1869, the steam railroad had spanned the heretofore unbridgeable American continent, speeding change to the remotest regions.

The first electronic network, the telegraph, accelerated the flow of information yet again. At the time of the founding of the American republic it took twenty-two and a half days for information to move between New York City and Charleston, South Carolina.15 Four score years later, news of the dissolution of that republic in Charleston Harbor moved instantly to New York by telegraph. “The speed of the telegraph is about as wonderful a thing as the noble invention itself,” observed Scientific American in 1852.16

A talented telegraph operator could transcribe at the rate of around three bits per second.17 Making information instantaneously available everywhere at a speed 100 times faster than delivery by horse further hastened the pace of life and the rate of change.

Today’s networks turn on the afterburners. Change is flying at us with gigabit connectivity (1 billion bits per second) and headed higher. That is more than 300 million times faster than the telegraph and 30 billion times faster than horseback.

As the velocity of the network increases, so does the speed with which it introduces change. In the process, twenty-first-century networks have destroyed the buffer that helped previous generations transition through change. Whereas previous new networks took years, if not generations, to mature, the current network revolution destroys old institutions and practices before it has ripened the capabilities necessary to replace them.

Data is speeding to us wherever we may be. On today’s digital

--------------------

The stories of previous network revolutions establish that “normal” is the institutionalization of what yesterday was inconceivable. They teach that in a time of technological turmoil, the greatest danger is not the turmoil itself but the attempt to cling to the comfortable ideas and institutions that remain from the last network revolution. Nonlinear thinking produced the technological change; its successful exploitation requires nonobvious innovation.

The challenge, of course, is the successful identification of the nonobvious. Later we will explore some of the issues created by our new network: the disappearance of privacy, the threat to jobs, the demands put on education, the rise of misinformation and its effects, both domestic and international.

n the following two years eighty editions were published throughout Germany.17

“The indulgences market collapsed like a popped dot-com,” one modern observer commented.18 The printers for whom the Church had been a mainstay of business could not have cared less, however. By one account, one-third of all the books printed in Germany from 1518 to 1525 were the product of Martin Luther’s pen.19

Reassembling the Old to Create the New

It is a wonder that the printing press that gave Luther his medium ever came to be.

For centuries, mankind had been on the precipice of printing. The components necessary for the movable-type printing press were all present in one form or another in the fifteenth century. Their assembly, however, was a medieval Rubik’s Cube of permutations and combinations.

The screw press was not new. As early as the Roman era, presses had been used to squeeze grapes and olives for their juice.

The assembling of individual characters, cut in reverse and inked to create an impression, had been used by the Chinese since the eleventh century. While the idea had not reached Europe, it was nonetheless clearly within human comprehension.

Inexpensive paper had come to Europe in the twelfth century from Arab countries, where the techniques for its production had been learned from Chinese prisoners four centuries earlier.

Ink had been around since the development of writing. Mixing carbon soot with various liquids to produce a mark was far from revolutionary.

While all of these preexisting capabilities had never been brought together, the printing press was more than their simple amalgam. Solving one part of the puzzle had the effect of opening the door to another problem. Conceptualizing how these basic techniques could work in harmony to enable mechanized printing was a sizable intellectual hurdle. Actually accomplishing that synergy was made infinitely more difficult by the need to adjust each technique so it would work with the others.

The press had to do more than apply a squeezing pressure. The pressure had to be delivered uniformly throughout; otherwise some text would be lighter or less sharp than others.

The individual characters had to be consistent in size and shape. Yes, the Chinese were the first to cut their characters into molds (first for clay characters and eventually for metal type), but the results were not uniform, and each character emerged from the mold with its own idiosyncrasies.

Most paper was too thin and too absorbent for printing on both sides. Imagine trying to print consistently on something similar to bathroom tissue!

--------------------

Johannes Gutenberg had been born into the emerging medieval middle class of craftsmen. His father was a goldsmith, a “Companion of the Mint” in Mainz, Germany, where he produced coinage. Johannes followed in his father’s footsteps to learn the art of working with metals.

The son was a skilled craftsman. He was also an entrepreneur in an age when entrepreneurs were building a new middle class. One of his many business activities—the buying and selling of wine—put him in proximity to the screw press used for squeezing wine grapes. A failed business undertaking, which probably also used a screw press, gave him further exposure to working with molten metal and produced the partnership that ended up in court

The evolution of medieval underwear helped solve one of Gutenberg’s related problems.27 Wool undergarments had clothed the populace since the beginning of haberdashery. Around the twelfth century, however, linen was substituted for wool. To its wearers, that in and of itself must have seemed a great leap forward. The shift had the unintended effect, however, of initiating a rag trade of discarded linen, which became a plentiful and low-cost source of raw material for paper

--------------------

It is worthwhile pausing at this point to savor Gutenberg’s success.

Imagine the exultation and celebration that must have gripped Johannes Gutenberg as his first printed book was bound!

More than a decade in development, Gutenberg’s understanding that a page of information was the sum of its parts had required a “secret art” to both discover a revolutionary new process and find the means of adjusting a seemingly endless number of variables into harmonious production.

Now it was done. Success had been achieved in twenty-eight pages of Latin grammar instruction.

The Western world had never before seen the rapid production of hundreds of perfect-quality pages, each one identical to the others. It was a moment to be savored, a decade-long quest with a transformative result.

Unfortunately, the exultation would be short-lived.

Other mass-market documents flowed from Gutenberg’s printing shop. The earliest dated work was a papal indulgence of 1454.33 Having spent more than a decade perfecting his technique, however, Gutenberg, it would appear, was not satisfied with such run-of-the-mill products. He wanted a monument. Today we call that monument the Gutenberg Bible.

It would be his downfall.
[3/1/2021 3:46 PM](calibre://show-book/_hex_-43616c696272655f4c696272617279/24/AZW3?open_at=epubcfi%28/26/2/4%5BAFM60%5E-becdc856e3104710a0b5001ee88a7eed%5D/2/174/1%3A0%29)

--------------------

Economically, printing was a capital-intensive undertaking. Large amounts of raw materials had to be purchased and held in inventory awaiting processing into a finished product, which then waited to be sold. This was especially true of the proposed Bible, a voluminous 1,275 pages. For a production run of around 175 copies (135 on paper, 40 on calfskin vellum), the project would require 5,000 calfskins for the vellum copies and more than 250,000 sheets of paper for the 135 less expensive versions.34 These investments were on top of the type that had to be produced (for which a new style was especially developed), ink that had to be bought, equipment that had to be built (a second printing shop was set up), and employees who had to be hired and trained.

To fund this undertaking Gutenberg turned to the Mainz businessman Johannes Fust. Fust had already lent him 800 gulden for the original printing shop. For a second 800-gulden loan to finance the Bible, Fust wanted increased security: Gutenberg’s Bible workshop and its equipment. If Gutenberg did not repay the loan, the printing shop would be Fust’s collateral.

In 1455, just as the Bibles approached completion—and the generation of revenue—Fust called his notes. Together with interest they totaled 2,026 gulden. Of course, Gutenberg could not pay; his assets were tied up in the about-to-be-sold books and the innovative technology to which he had devoted more than a decade of his life.

Johannes Fust became the new owner of the world’s largest inventory of Bibles and the revolutionary technology by which they were produced. He and his son-in-law (Gutenberg’s assistant, Peter Schöffer) took over the business.

After such shrewd—some might say dastardly—behavior, Fust perhaps got his due. There is an often repeated (perhaps apocryphal) story about Fust’s efforts to sell his Bibles. The best market for his

product was the city with more universities and more students than any other in Europe. Off to Paris went Fust and his ill-won gains. He reportedly sold one vellum copy to the king and another to the archbishop of Paris. Paper editions were sold to the lesser clergy and common folk.

Apparently, however, Fust did not disclose how his Bibles had been created. When the archbishop, proud of his purchase, showed it to the king, they discovered to their amazement that except for the hand-painted illuminations, every page of their two books was identical. The Confrérie des Libraries, Relieurs, Elumineurs, Escrivans et Parcheminiers—the book producers’ guild—was called to give its opinion.

Professional inspection confirmed the books were not the work of scribes. The craftsmen whose skills were threatened by the new technology opined that such perfection could not have been achieved other than by dubious means. The Church declared such perfect copies could only be the work of the Devil.

Johannes Fust was accused of being a heretic. Threatened with being burned at the stake, he fled.35

Many of the items we take for granted today originated as products of the printed word. As shipbuilding and navigation improved, for instance, English woolens began to arrive in Italy to undercut the domestic market. Italian businesses, in response, looked to their specialized strengths to develop an alternative market of high-quality goods that continues today.

Consumers accessing the newly available books often discovered they were farsighted and needed glasses. This new demand for optical lenses in turn expanded experimentation in optical physics, which led to the development of the microscope and the discovery of cellular biology.42

Similarly, the kind of statistical analysis that permeates our lives, from television ratings to political polling and insurance premiums, began with the sixteenth-century publication of census information.43 Even Latin, formerly the domain of contracts and of the Church, began its trek toward the mortuary. As printers published in the vernacular to attract the widest audience, understanding Latin was no longer the prerequisite to accessing information in texts.44

While Baltimore’s rail line first stumbled with multiple approaches to the new idea—trying horse-drawn railcars, cars propelled by horses on treadmills, and even sail power (Baltimore was, after all, a sailing town)—the B&O ultimately embraced the new English invention of steam locomotion. In 1830 the B&O became the first American railroad to haul both freight and passengers by steam on a regular schedule.

Laying tracks atop the land was faster and more practical than excavating a canal. By the time the C&O Canal had reached its terminus at Cumberland, Maryland, in 1850, the B&O Railroad had been there for eight years. Not only could railroads be constructed more quickly, they also moved their contents infinitely faster. Whereas canal boats crept along at around four miles per hour, the early locomotives sped over the rails at blazing speeds of up to twenty miles per hour (and they kept getting faster).

The Stourbridge Lion (named after the English town where it was constructed) pulled the first load over the tramway on August 8, 1829. Unfortunately, it suffered the same fate as Trevithick’s locomotive. The rails could not support the engine’s weight. It went into a storage shed and never emerged.44

A year later, the B&O Railroad, which had tried everything from horses to sails as a means of propulsion, finally tried steam locomotion. On August 28, 1830, a small steam engine named for P. T. Barnum’s diminutive star Tom Thumb hauled thirty-six people at speeds of up to eighteen miles an hour.45 The engine’s builder, Peter Cooper, had learned from the Stourbridge Lion’s failure and built an engine light enough for the rails over which it would travel.46

Tom Thumb introduced speed to North America. Racing at four and a half times the speed of any other conveyance, Tom Thumb was both a marvel and a mystery. The train’s owners and occupants first questioned whether the human body could endure such speed. Many of the passengers on Tom Thumb’s first run were human guinea pigs who brought along paper and pencil to test whether cogent thought was possible at such speed.47

In a foretelling of challenges to come, the incumbent stagecoach operators tried to nip the puffing competitor in the bud, arranging a race between a horse-drawn carriage and the locomotive. The horse shot out of the blocks as the engine built up steam. Once fully under way, however, Tom Thumb closed the gap and surged ahead. The puffer held a comfortable lead until a blower belt slipped and the horse galloped past. The locomotive had lost the race, but not the contest. The leadership of the B&O redirected its efforts into becoming an all-steam railroad.4

The United States was late to the Industrial Revolution for two principal reasons: the lack of adequate power and the absence of an adequate market.59 The fall line that ran along the East Coast provided power from cascading water but geographically constrained early industrialization. The poor connections among cities and regions created a balkanized marketplace that further constrained both the stimulation and the sustaining of scope and scale production. The spread of railroads created a synergy that vanquished those restraints.

The railroad was an industrial perpetual-motion machine. Created at first to haul the products of mines, railroads soon became the largest consumer of one of those mines’ extracts: coal. In a similar manner, railroad construction drove demand for the high-volume production of other manufactured goods. Steam-powered mills were required to produce the lumber used for ties and trestles. Likewise, iron and steel production expanded to meet the demand for engines and rails. These and other products were, of course, delivered by rail

That schedule and the new importance of timeliness created an opportunity for Richard W. Sears, the twenty-two-year-old North Rosewood, Minnesota, station agent for the Minneapolis and St. Louis Railroad. When in 1886 a local jewelry store refused a consignment of watches, Sears stepped in, agreeing to pay the watchmaker $12.00 for every watch he sold. Sears correctly recognized that the railroad’s schedule made his passengers especially sensitive to timeliness, thus making them an ideal target audience for the products. For his sales force, Sears turned to his fellow station agents, who were already interconnected by a means of distribution. Within six months, Sears had netted $5,000, quit his job, and started the R. W. Sears Watch Company. The following year he hired his first employee, a watch repairman named Alvah Curtis Roebuck.

Not surprisingly, as the railroad steamed over tradition, it was met by a countervailing force. Those opposed to the change warned that the racing passage of a steam locomotive would cause cows to stop grazing and hens to cease laying. Birds would drop from the sky from the smokestack’s exhaust of poisoned air. And horses, replaced by engines, would become extinct, with the result that farmers of hay and oats would go bankrup

In the summer of 1821, Babbage and a colleague were reviewing a set of mathematical tables being prepared for the Royal Astronomical Society. The calculations had been performed by “computers,” individuals who did each calculation by hand. Because of the potential for error, it was common practice to have two different computers work on a project and to compare the results as a cross-check. Inconsistencies were flagged for recalculation.

Reviewing the tables was mind-numbing. One reviewer would read to the other a list of numbers as his partner compared them with the set he was studying. The intense concentration and repetitious boredom would cause the reviewers to stumble and have to go back and start again. It also caused Babbage to call for an automated solution.88

By the following June, Babbage had completed a small working model of a mechanical calculator that he called a “difference engine.” A collection of vertical rods, each of which stored a single digit that was the result of the interaction of nine cogged wheels on the rod representing the numbers zero to nine, the difference engine was a monument to both mathematics and precision machining. Whereas the crude calculators of the time required human intervention (and thus the introduction of errors) to deal with the “carry” issue of moving a number from the units to the tens, from the tens to the hundreds, and so forth, Babbage’s difference engine automated the “carry.”89 Charles Babbage had mechanized mathematics.

Between the summers of 1834 and 1836, Babbage had conceptualized the components of what we today recognize as a computer. In incredibly detailed blueprints, Babbage laid out a central processing unit (which he called a “mill”) that would rely on its own internal procedures, expandable memory (which he called the “store”), an input device driven by punch cards, and an output printer. The unit used base 10 arithmetic and was capable of if-then conditional branching, the preparation of a result in advance of its need (equivalent to microprogramming), and the use of multiple processors to speed the calculation by splitting the task (parallel processing)
